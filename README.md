# Web Developer Test - March 2019

## Introduction

Welcome to the King's Online web developer test. This a short programming task that is designed to see how you approach problem-solving a technical issue. Please commit your response to your own git repository and then email the link to louise.bennett@kcl.ac.uk by **Wednesday, March 27th at 17.00**.

## The problem

The King's Online team is made up of roughly 40 members in a large number of job roles (from video to instructional design to visual design and so on). Like most large teams, the team is broken down into sub-teams, all of whom report up to another member of staff. A (somewhat out-of-date) organisational structure can be seen [in this document](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/learningteaching/kings-online/ko-organisational-structure.pdf).

For this test you will be working with a dataset that represents our team - potentially your future colleagues! 

You have been provided with a dataset (data.js) and a mock-up of how we want the data to be presented.

## Data structure

_id_ - String. The unique ID representing an individual. 

_firstName_ - String. The first name of the individual.

_lastName_ - String. The last name of the individual.

_jobTitle_ - String. The job of the individual.

_reportsTo_ - String. The name of the job title the individual reports to.

_dateJoined_ - Date Object. The date the individual joined the team. 

## Task

To successfully complete the task, you must: 

1. Create the html/php file and print the data, creating a profile card for each individual (refer to the wireframes png file)
2. Sort the list of individuals by last name alphabetical (descending)
3. Sort the cards by the date they joined the team (descending) 

## Styling (optional)

This task focuses on your ability to handle and manipulate data. Styling is completely optional and below are our design guidelines (developer handover):

_Headings_ - Impact, regular weight, 2.618rem

_Body Text_ - Georgia, 2.618rem

_Card Background Colour_ - #CDD7DC

_Profile Pic Placeholder Background Colour_ - #5A6469

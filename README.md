# Web Developer Test - March 2019

## Introduction

Welcome to the King's Online web developer test. This a short programming task that is designed to see how you approach problem-solving a technical issue. Please commit your response to a git repository and then email the link to louise.bennett@kcl.ac.uk by **Wednesday, March 27th at 17.00**.

## The problem

The King's Online team is made up of roughly 40 members in a large number of job roles (from video to instructional design to visual design and so on). Like most large teams, the team is broken down into sub-teams, all of whom report up to another member of staff. A (somewhat out-of-date) organisational structure can be seen [in this document](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/learningteaching/kings-online/ko-organisational-structure.pdf).

For this test you will be working with a dataset that represents our team - potentially your future colleagues! 

You have been provided with a dataset (data.js), a mock-up of how we want the data to be presented, and some CSS for styling it.

## Data structure

_id_ - String. The unique ID representing an individual. 

_firstName_ - String. The first name of the individual.

_lastName_ - String. The last name of the individual.

_jobTitle_ - String. The job of the individual.

_reportsTo_ - Array. An array of strings with the name of the job title the individual reports to.

_dateJoined_ - String. The date the individual joined the team. 

## Task

To successfully complete the task, you must: 

1. Create the html/php
2. Print the data, creating a card for each individual as per the mock-up
3. Sort the list of individuals by last name alphabetical (descending)
4. Sort the cards by the date they joined the team (descending)
